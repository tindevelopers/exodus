# Exodus Theme — Architecture

This theme is based on Shopify's Dawn reference theme. Preserve its structure and conventions.

## Settings Preservation

- **config/settings_schema.json**: Extend by adding new groups; do not remove Dawn's default groups (logo, colors, typography, etc.).
- **config/settings_data.json**: Never overwrite blindly; it is updated by the theme editor.
- **templates/*.json**: Extend JSON templates; add sections to existing templates rather than replacing them wholesale.
- **locales/en.default.json**: Add keys for custom sections; keep existing keys.

## Asset Strategy

- Use `{% stylesheet %}` and `{% javascript %}` in sections/blocks/snippets; avoid adding to `assets/` unless critical for every page.
- Reference theme settings via `{{ settings.color_primary }}` and similar.

## Workflow

Figma → Builder.io → Liquid: Convert designs into sections/blocks with proper `{% schema %}` so merchants can customize in the theme editor.
